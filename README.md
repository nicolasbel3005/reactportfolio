# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
React Portfolio Web Developer README
Overview
Welcome to your journey as a web developer! This README outlines the steps to create and deploy your React portfolio. This portfolio will showcase your projects, highlight your skills, and facilitate collaboration with other developers. It's an essential tool for job applications, freelancing, or simply sharing your work within the developer community.

Objective
Your task is to build a single-page application portfolio using React. This will distinguish you from others by demonstrating your ability to use the latest technologies. Once completed, you'll deploy your portfolio on Netlify.

User Story
As an employer looking for candidates skilled in building single-page applications,
I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples,
So that I can assess their suitability for an open position.
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer,
WHEN I load the portfolio,
THEN I am presented with a header, content section, and footer.
WHEN I view the header,
THEN I see the developer's name and navigation with titles for different portfolio sections.
WHEN I view navigation titles,
THEN they include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the current section highlighted.
WHEN I click on a navigation title,
THEN the corresponding section appears below without reloading the page, and that title is highlighted.
WHEN I first load the portfolio,
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default.
WHEN viewing the About Me section,
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio.
WHEN viewing the Portfolio section,
THEN I see titled images of six applications with links to deployed versions and GitHub repositories.
WHEN viewing the Contact section,
THEN I see a contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
WHEN moving the cursor out of a form field without entering text,
THEN I receive a notification that the field is required.
WHEN entering text into the email field,
THEN I receive a notification for invalid email addresses.
WHEN viewing the Resume section,
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of proficiencies.
WHEN viewing the footer,
THEN I find links to the developerâ€™s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
